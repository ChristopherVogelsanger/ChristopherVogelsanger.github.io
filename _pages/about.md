As humans, our strong reliance on vision has led to the development of software that not only creates visually appealing content but also comprehends and interprets the visual language crafted by us. Computer graphics and computer vision play a crucial role in how we interact with technology. Computer graphics focuses on presenting information in a clear and aesthetically pleasing way. Be it to aid in solving important tasks or to simply entertain by showing us incredible visuals, stories and worlds in movies and games. Computer vision on the other hand aims to enable software to perceive and interpret the visual aspects of our world, simplifying our interaction with technology and enhancing intuitive communication with software. Overall, both computer graphics and vision work towards making technology seamlessly integrated into human experiences.

Machine learning has emerged as a valuable tool for solving hard problems across various domains. Its capacity to learn correlations from observed data proves instrumental in simplifying complexities and connecting the precise software paradigm with the inherently unpredictable real world. This is especially true in computer vision and graphics where it can be infeasible to describe desired outcomes in in conventional code. Instead, it is more efficient to show a machine learning model what we expect. However, this approach introduces challenges as it involves giving up some control in favor of feasibility and convenience.
